## 🚀 Project Overview

[CodinIT.dev](https://codinit.dev) is the first open-source AI‑powered application development platform that converts natural language prompts into fully fledged, production-ready code. It supports frameworks such as Next.js, Vue.js, Flutter, and a Python FastAPI backend.

### Key Highlights

- **Natural-language-to-fullstack**: Describe your app in plain English and CodinIT generates everything—from frontend components to API/server logic.
- **Live updating preview**: Watch as generated code executes in real time, with instant visual feedback on app changes.
- **Multi-framework support**: Includes Next.js (React), Vue 3 (PWA), Flutter mobile, and Python FastAPI, all scaffolded via prompt.
- **AI code review & optimisation**: Automatically suggests bug fixes, improves performance, and reinforces accessibility best practices.
- **Seamless deployment**: Export clean, deployable code ready for platforms like Vercel, Netlify, AWS, or self-host environments.

## 🛠️ Use Cases & Value

- **Rapid prototyping**: Generate full-stack apps (e‑commerce, dashboards, utilities) from prompts in minutes.
- **Lowered dev barrier**: Enables non-developers to build MVPs, while empowering developers to prototype faster.
- **Accelerated workflows**: Real-time preview and AI cleanup reduce iteration cycles by ~70%.
- **Extensible platform**: Open‑source codebase facilitates customization, self-hosting, and community contributions.
