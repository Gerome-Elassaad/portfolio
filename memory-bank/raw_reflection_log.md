TaskRef: "Fix TypeScript errors in src/app/page.tsx related to 'technical' property and implicit 'any' types"

Learnings:
- Discrepancies between data structures in definition files (e.g., `content.js`) and consuming files (e.g., `page.tsx`) are a common source of 'property does not exist' errors in TypeScript.
- When renaming properties or restructuring data in a source file, all dependent components must be updated to reflect these changes in both property access and rendering logic.
- For example, renaming `techStacks` to `technical` and changing its internal structure from separate arrays (frontend, backend) to a single `skills` array required significant updates in `page.tsx`.
- Explicitly defining interfaces for complex objects (e.g., `TechnicalSkill`, `ImageProps`) and typing parameters in callback functions (e.g., `.map((item: Type, index: number) => ...)`) is crucial for catching type errors early and improving code maintainability.
- React list keys should be unique and stable. Using a combination of a unique property and index (e.g., `${skill.title}-${index}`) is a common pattern.

Difficulties:
- Initial modification of `content.js` (renaming `techStacks` to `technical` and restructuring) led to new errors in `page.tsx` because the old rendering logic for `techStacks` was still present and incompatible. This required a second pass on `page.tsx` to remove the obsolete code block and correctly implement the rendering for the new `technical.skills` structure.
- Overlooked the need to update the rendering logic in `page.tsx` for the `techStacks` (now `technical`) section in the first pass. The old code iterated over `frontend`, `backend`, `Integrations` separately, while the new structure is a single `skills` array.

Successes:
- Successfully identified that the `technical` property was missing from the `about` object in `content.js` and that `techStacks` was the intended data.
- Correctly refactored `content.js` to rename `techStacks` to `technical` and restructure its content into a `skills` array as expected by `page.tsx`.
- Updated `page.tsx` to use the new `about.technical` structure, added the `TechnicalSkill` interface, and provided explicit types for map callback parameters, resolving all reported TypeScript errors.
- The iterative approach of modifying, observing feedback (new errors), and then further refining proved effective.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- General pattern: When refactoring data structures, ensure all consuming code is updated simultaneously or in close succession to avoid cascading errors. Pay attention to both property access and rendering logic.
- TypeScript: Always define interfaces for shared object structures and use explicit types for function parameters, especially in callbacks.
